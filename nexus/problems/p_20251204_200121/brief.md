# Problem: Booking System Showcases for Web Design Catalog

## Customer Request (Exact Words)
"I want you to generate 5 such showcases with 5 agents for the web-design-catalog"

Generate implementation showcases for booking systems (Fortbildungen/professional training courses), each positioned along emotional experience axes.

## Initial Analysis
- Components involved: 5 booking system variants
- Technical domains: Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS), UX design, emotional axis positioning
- Uncertainty level: low (clear specification provided)

## Success Criteria
- [ ] JSON schema created for showcase specifications
- [ ] 5 JSON specs generated for different emotional configurations
- [ ] 5 agents created and executed
- [ ] 5 complete showcases (HTML + CSS + JS) integrated into catalog

## Constraints
- Must align with existing catalog structure in /components/
- Must follow emotional-axis framework (Curiosity↔Clarity, Spark Interest↔Reduce Friction, Exploration↔Efficiency)
- Must include core booking features: course listing, availability, reservation flow, payment stubs, confirmation

## Emotional Configurations
1. **Reduce Friction / Clarity / Efficiency** - Fast 15-second booking for busy professionals
2. **Spark Interest / Curiosity / Exploration** - Discovery-focused for newcomers
3. **Balanced Middle Model** - Mixed audiences
4. **Advisor-centered** - Professional/expert mindset
5. **New-user Onboarding** - First-time explorers

## Estimated Complexity
- State space: 5 components × 3 files each = 15 artifacts
- Interaction depth: 2 (schema → specs → implementation)
- **Complexity score**: 30
- **Recommended agents**: 5 (one per showcase)
